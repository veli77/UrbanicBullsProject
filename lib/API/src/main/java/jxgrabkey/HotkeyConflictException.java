/**
 * This Exception is thrown when another application already registered a hotkey
 * which JXGrabKey tried to register for itself.
 * X11 hotkeys can only be registered by one application at a time.
 * Because JXGrabKey registers the same hotkey with different combinations of
 * offending masks like scrolllock, numlock and capslock,
 * any of those registrations can be the cause of the conflict.
 * It is best to unregister the hotkey after receiving this exception.
 * Otherwise the hotkey may not work at all, or may not work with all mask combinations.
